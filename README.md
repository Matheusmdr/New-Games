### 📜 Documentation (We know, this part is so boring...):

The entire project specification is described in Portuguese in the following document:
[TrabalhoWeb.pdf](https://github.com/Matheusmdr/Trabalho-Final-Desenvolvimento-Web/blob/main/TrabalhoWeb.pdf) 

I'm sorry, if you can't speak Portuguese...😢(look on the bright side, you can have fun with the cool part of the project and ignore the boring part LOL). 
(PS: Briefly summarizing, the project is an online game store 🤫)
